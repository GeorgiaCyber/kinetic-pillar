## This file defines which hosts have access to which pillar data.
## The only time you should have to edit this file is when you add/
## remove a type of physical host or add a new openstack service.
## In general, hosts will need access to:
## 1. Their specification file (virtual if a VM, hosts if physical
## 2. Their mine configuration (if any)
## 3. Their OpenStack service definition
## Other entries can be added/removed as needed.
